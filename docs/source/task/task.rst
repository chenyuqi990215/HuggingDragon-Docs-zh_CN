Currently, the framework supports the following key tasks:

* Trajectory Recovery: This task focuses on recovering missing trajectory points from a given trajectory with a low sample rate, enabling the reconstruction of a more complete trajectory.

* Trajectory Similarity: The framework also facilitates finding the most similar trajectory among a given set of trajectories, allowing for effective comparison and analysis.

To provide a comprehensive solution, HuggingDragon intends to expand its capabilities by incorporating additional tasks in the near future. These planned tasks include:

* Route Representation Learning (RRL): RRL aims to learn trajectory representations in a self-supervised manner, enabling enhanced understanding and analysis of trajectory data.

* Estimation of Time of Arrival (ETA): ETA focuses on predicting the travel time of a trajectory, offering valuable insights for planning and optimizing transportation routes.

* Trajectory Modeling: HuggingDragon will provide the ability to learn a generative model that estimates the density of a set of trajectories, enabling the understanding and modeling of trajectory patterns.

* Next Point of Interest (POI) Recommendation: This task focuses on predicting the next POI points given a user's history trajectory, providing personalized recommendations and enhancing user experiences in navigation and location-based services.

* Traffic Signal Control: This task aims to incorporate traffic signal control based on historical trajectories, allowing for intelligent and data-driven management of traffic signals to optimize traffic flow.

With these planned tasks, HuggingDragon aspires to provide a comprehensive and unified framework that empowers researchers and practitioners in the ITS field to address critical challenges and drive advancements in trajectory-based applications.

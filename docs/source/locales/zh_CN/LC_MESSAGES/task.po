"GPS trajectories are essential foundations for applications such as "
"travel time estimation, traffic prediction, and trajectory similarity "
"measurement. However, real-life trajectories often suffer from low sample"
" rates, limiting their effectiveness. Additionally, existing map matching"
" algorithms face challenges with low-sample trajectories. Trajectory "
"recovery aims to increase the sample rate by filling in missing points, "
"enriching low-sample trajectories."

msgid ""
"Given a low-sample raw GPS trajectory with measurement errors, the task "
"of trajectory recovery aims to recover the real map-matched trajectory. "
"Specifically, for each low-sample trajectory, it infers the missing GPS "
"points and maps each GPS point (including the GPS points in the input "
"trajectory) onto the road network to obtain the real GPS locations of the"
" moving trajectory [1]_."
